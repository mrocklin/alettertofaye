<p> Faye's frustrations are both very common and easy to prevent. I get an
e-mail like this about once a month. After writing so many I've decided just to
post my response online.</p>

Hi Faye,

<p>
I would do the following:

<p>
I would update your internet browser to a newer edition. An internet browser
is a program like "Internet Explorer" or "Safari"; it is the program you click
on to access the intenet. Newer versions can detect most bad programs before 
they reach your computer. I highly recommend 
<a href=https://www.google.com/chrome/>Google Chrome</a>. 
You would want to make sure that you double click on the Chrome icon whenever 
you access the Internet rather than your old program.

<p>
If you're using Windows, you should check that it has been updating itself. If 
a little yellow window has been popping up in the lower right of your screen
telling you to install updates then you should click on it and follow the
instructions. This should be easy. 

<p>
Most computer issues these days aren't the old sort of virus that McAffe was
originally designed to handle. Things have changed since McAffe's day. If you
do want an anti-virus program I think the standard solution these days is
<a href=http://download.cnet.com/AVG-Anti-Virus-Free-Edition-2012/3000-2239_4-10320142.html>AVG</a>.
The free version is sufficient. If it were me I would
also uninstall McAffe. While it does offer protection it also has the bad habit
of slowing down the computer while it scans for viruses which, by default, it
does every day. AVG would likely do this as well. If you hunt around in
the program options you'll be able to find some setting to make the scans 
weekly or monthly. 

<p>
Many problems arise from malicious programs that aren't viruses but are instead
called "malware" or "spyware". These are usually but not always taken care of
by anti-virus programs like AVG. You can also download and install more
specialized programs to handle these issues if you think AVG isn't catching
everything. A popular one today is
<a href=http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html>MalawareBytes</a>.

<p>
If your computer is ok now (doesn't have a virus) then I would install and use 
Google Chrome and forget about the issue. This is what I do. I don't even
have an anti-virus program running and I've been fine for years. If something
does happen then you should install and run AVG. If that doesn't work then
you should install and run Malawarebytes. 

<p>
Additionally, its good just to be mindful of installing any small program
that a suspicious website offers to you. Before a bad program enters your 
computer it needs to get your permission. Most of the time this will be a
little pop up window on a website that asks you to install something. 

<p> Of course, good websites need to do this too. For example a website that
plays movies like Netflix will need you to install something. You should let
it. Whenever a small pop up window comes up though you should become suspicious
and make sure that you're on a good, reputable website. Chrome is pretty good
about warning you when you're on a suspicious website but some suspicion on 
your part is good too.

<p>
Here are some useful links:
<ul>
    <li> Google Chrome <a href=https://www.google.com/chrome/>https://www.google.com/chrome/</a>
    <li> AVG <a href=http://download.cnet.com/AVG-Anti-Virus-Free-Edition-2012/3000-2239_4-10320142.html>http://download.cnet.com/AVG-Anti-Virus-Free-Edition-2012/3000-2239_4-10320142.html</a>
    <li> MalawareBytes <a href=http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html>http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html</a>
</ul>

<p>Best of luck,

<p>-Matt

<p> For the technically inclined:

<p> I chose Chrome because I use and like it. It is also well known for its
good security. I chose AVG and MalawareBytes purely because they are the most
downloaded antivirus and anti-malware programs on download.com. I have also
heard about and used AVG in the past.
